## 🎮 Interactive Labs
- **[Grafana Play](https://play.grafana.org/)** - A sandbox provided by Grafana to explore complex dashboards without setting anything up.
- **[Prometheus PromQL Labs](https://promlabs.com/promql-training/)** - Practice writing the queries that drive your alerts.

## ⚡ Quick Tasks
1. **Query Master:** Write a PromQL query that shows the rate of requests over the last 5 minutes.
2. **Alert Logic:** Define a "critical" alert threshold vs. a "warning" threshold for RAM usage.
3. **Log Search:** Construct a Kibana query that finds all logs containing the word "ERROR" but NOT the word "TIMEOUT".
4. **Dashboard Polish:** Change a Grafana graph into a "Gauge" or a "Stat" panel for a specific single value.
