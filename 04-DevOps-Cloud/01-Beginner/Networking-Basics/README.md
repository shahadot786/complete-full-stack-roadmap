# 🌐 Networking Basics for DevOps

Understanding how data moves through a network is crucial for troubleshooting and cloud architecture.

## 🗺️ Learning Roadmap

### 1. The Models
- **OSI Model:** 7 Layers (Physical to Application)
- **TCP/IP Model:** 4 Layers

### 2. Addressing and Protocols
- **IP Addressing:** IPv4 vs. IPv6, CIDR blocks, Subnetting
- **TCP vs. UDP:** Reliability vs. Speed
- **Common Protocols:** HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, SSH, FTP, SMTP
- **Ports:** Well-known ports (22, 80, 443, 3306)

### 3. Troubleshooting Tools
- `ping`: Test connectivity
- `traceroute`/`tracert`: Path to a host
- `nslookup`/`dig`: DNS queries
- `netstat`/`ss`: Active connections
- `curl`/`wget`: Testing web endpoints

## 🛠️ Hands-on Projects
1. **DNS Lookup Tool:** Build a Bash script that takes a domain name and returns its IP, MX records, and Name Servers.
2. **Local Network Scanner:** Use `nmap` (if installed) or a simple script to find active devices in your subnet.
3. **Static Website Hosting (Local):** Setup a local server (Python `http.server` or Nginx) and access it via IP.
