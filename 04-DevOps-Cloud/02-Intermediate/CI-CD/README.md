Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is the heart of DevOps.

## 🗺️ Learning Roadmap

- Continuous Integration vs. Delivery vs. Deployment
- Shifting Left (Testing early)

### 2. GitHub Actions
- Workflows, Jobs, and Steps
- Events and Triggers
- Using Pre-built Actions
- Secrets and Environment Management

### 3. Other Tools
- **GitLab CI/CD:** `.gitlab-ci.yml`
- **Jenkins:** Pipelines as Code (Jenkinsfile)
- **CircleCI** / **Travis CI** essentials

### 4. Quality Gates
- Automated Testing (Unit, Integration, E2E)
- Static Code Analysis (SonarQube, Linting)
- Security Scanning (Snyk, Trivy)
