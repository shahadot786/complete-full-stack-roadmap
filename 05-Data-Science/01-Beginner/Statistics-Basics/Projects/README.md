# 🛠️ Statistics Basics - Projects

## Project 1: Descriptive Statistics Calculator
**Goal:** Build functions to compute stats from scratch (no numpy).
- Mean, median, mode
- Variance and standard deviation
- Percentiles and quartiles

## Project 2: Probability Simulator
**Goal:** Simulate classic probability problems.
- Coin flip sequences (streaks analysis)
- Monte Carlo estimation of Pi
- Monty Hall problem simulation

## Project 3: Distribution Visualizer
**Goal:** Create interactive plots of common distributions.
- Normal distribution with different μ and σ
- Binomial distribution with varying n and p
- Overlay empirical data on theoretical curves
