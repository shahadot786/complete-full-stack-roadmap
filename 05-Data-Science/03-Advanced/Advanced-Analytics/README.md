# 📈 Advanced Analytics

Go beyond basic analysis with rigorous statistical methods.

## 🗺️ Learning Roadmap

### 1. A/B Testing
- Experiment design
- Sample size calculation
- Statistical significance and p-values
- Multi-armed bandits
- Common pitfalls (peeking, multiple comparisons)

### 2. Time Series Analysis

- Stationarity and differencing
- ARIMA models
- Prophet and modern forecasting
- Evaluation metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE)

### 3. Statistical Modeling
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- Regularization (Ridge, Lasso)
- Feature selection

### 4. Causal Inference
- Correlation vs. causation
- Randomized experiments
- Propensity score matching
- Difference-in-differences
