## 💡 Startup-Specific Questions

### Product Thinking

**Q:** "How would you improve our product?"

**Good Answer:**
- Used the product extensively
- Identified specific pain points
- Proposed data-driven solutions
- Considered trade-offs
- Aligned with company goals

**Example:**
"I noticed the onboarding flow has 5 steps. Based on my experience, users drop off at step 3 (payment). I'd suggest:
1. Move payment to the end
2. Add social proof at step 3
3. A/B test the new flow
4. Measure conversion improvement"

### Technical Decisions

**Q:** "Should we use microservices or monolith?"

**Good Answer:**
- Consider team size
- Evaluate complexity
- Discuss trade-offs
- Recommend based on stage

**Example:**
"For a 10-person team, I'd start with a well-structured monolith:
- Faster development
- Easier debugging
- Lower operational overhead
- Can extract services later when needed

Microservices make sense when:
- Team > 50 people
- Clear service boundaries
- Independent scaling needs"
