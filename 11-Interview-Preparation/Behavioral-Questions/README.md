## 🎯 The STAR Method

**A**ction - Explain what you did  
**R**esult - Share the outcome (quantify if possible)

### Example Answer Structure:

**Question:** "Tell me about a time you faced a difficult challenge."

**S:** "In my previous role as a backend engineer, our API response times increased to 3+ seconds during peak hours, affecting 50,000+ users."

**T:** "I was tasked with identifying the bottleneck and reducing response time to under 500ms within two weeks."

**A:** "I profiled the application, identified N+1 query issues, implemented database indexing, added Redis caching for frequently accessed data, and optimized our ORM queries."

**R:** "Response times dropped to 200ms average, user complaints decreased by 90%, and we handled 3x more traffic during the next peak period."
